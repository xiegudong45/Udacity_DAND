## Summary
Prosper Loan Data contains 113,937 loan information with 81 attributes for each loan, including loan amount, original loan data, borrower rate , current loan status, and many others. I selected some of them which are important to visualize.

## Design
* I tried to show some useful information from the lenders' perspective.
* I visualized the sum of loan amount of each states and filtered them by years using single value list.
* I think people's employment status would have a large impact on their loan amount, so I used a pie chart to illustrate what I observed. I compared them over the years.
* It is very important to know the loan amount difference between people who owned a house or not. This was compared over the years, a line chart was most suitable.
* Finally, I would like to find out what aspects people spent their loans on. I tracked the annual trends of data.
