## Summary
Prosper Loan Data contains 113,937 loan information with 81 attributes for each loan, including loan amount, original loan data, borrower rate , current loan status, and many others. I selected some of them which are important to visualize.

## Design
* I tried to show some useful information from the lenders' perspective.
* I visualized the sum of loan amount of each states and filtered them by years using single value list.
* I think people's employment status would have a large impact on their loan amount, so I used a pie chart to illustrate what I observed. I compared them over the years.
* It is very important to know the loan amount difference between people who owned a house or not. This was compared over the years, a line chart was most suitable.
* Finally, I would like to find out what aspects people spent their loans on. I tracked the annual trends of data.

## Feedback
* Please use units for the labels in the x-axis and the y-axis.
* Please check for spelling of words in captions.
* Please remove the strike across the filter for comparing income
  range and loan status group. Instead of removing the selected
  filter element, you can actually show the data for which the
  user has selected in the filter.
* Tick mark and striking are 2 contrast thing. Better use tick mark
  to show only the filter element.
