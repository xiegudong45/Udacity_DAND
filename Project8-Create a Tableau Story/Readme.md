# Create a Tableau Story
Analyzing real-world data using Tableau.

## Description
This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:

* visualization is a dialog
* showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
* visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements

By finishing this project I will gain a deeper understanding of how to analyze the data, and tell people a story based on what findings I think are the most crucial.

# Project Details

## Introduction
For this project, I created a Tableau story that illustrated the clear findings or highlighted relationships in a dataset.

## Step 1 - Choose a dataset
I chose Prosper Loan Data. It is a dataset which kept track of loan status in United States since 2005.

## Step 2 - Get Organized
This repo includes the following:
* Write-up: PDF or Markdown file that includes links to my Tableau Public workbooks, published online, and a write-up with four sections.
  - Summary: in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce the data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
  - Design: explain any design choices I made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
  - Feedback: include all feedback I received from others on my visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
  - Resources: list any sources I consulted to create my visualization
* Data Files
the final data set used to create the visualization (usually .csv, .tsv, or .json file)

## Step 3 - Find a Data Story
Explore my data set and craft a message or story around your data! Think about the overall message I want to convey and think about the comparison(s) or relationship(s) I want my readers to see. Remember that I will ultimately need to create a visualization that is explanatory, helping lead a reader to identify one or more key insights into the dataset.


## Step 4 - Create Your Visualization
First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the write-up. Then, create your visualization using Tableau. The visualization must include animation, interaction, or both.

## Step 5 - Get Feedback
Share your visualization with at least one other person and document their feedback. There are many ways to get feedback, and more feedback is generally better! Here are some options.

* Share your visualization with others in person and have them think aloud as they read and explore the graphic so you can document what stands out to them and how they interpret the graphic.
* Share a link to your project in your Study Group, or Slack community, depending on what version of the program you are in, and ask others to share their constructive criticisms. Be sure to offer advice to others who are seeking feedback too!

## Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization
For each person that gives feedback, add the personâ€™s feedback to the write-up file in the Feedback section. As I improve and iterate on the visualization, update the visualization AND describe any changes in the Design section of the write-up.

I should save multiple versions of your data visualization after I make changes to it. Remember to save related files with similar numbers.

My goal is to build evidence that I have shared the visualization, received feedback, and responded to that feedback. I need to submit an initial version of your data visualization and the final version with the corresponding write-up.
